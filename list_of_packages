Here is the list of packages we will probably be using (still updating)

keras is the main one for our cnn algorithm 

cv2 and os is needed to treat the raw data
'''

import os
import numpy as np
import cv2
from __future__ import print_function
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, merge, Convolution2D, MaxPooling2D, UpSampling2D
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint, LearningRateScheduler
from keras import backend as K
from data import load_train_data, load_test_data
